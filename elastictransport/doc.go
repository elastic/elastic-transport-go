Package elastictransport provides the transport layer for the Elastic clients.

# Creating a Client

Use [NewClient] with functional [Option] values to create a transport client:

	u, _ := url.Parse("https://localhost:9200")
	tp, err := elastictransport.NewClient(
	    elastictransport.WithURLs(u),
	    elastictransport.WithBasicAuth("elastic", "changeme"),
	    elastictransport.WithMaxRetries(5),
	)

Options are applied in order; when the same setting is specified more than once
the last value wins.

The older [New] + [Config] API is still available for backwards compatibility
but is deprecated. New code should prefer [NewClient].

# HTTP Transport

The default HTTP transport of the client is http.Transport; use [WithTransport]
to customize it.

# Retries

The package will automatically retry requests on network-related errors, and on
specific response status codes (by default 502, 503, 504). Use [WithRetry] to
set the maximum retries and retryable status codes in one call, or use
[WithMaxRetries] and [WithRetryOnStatus] individually. Use [WithDisableRetry] to
disable the retry behaviour altogether.

By default, the retry will be performed without any delay; to configure a
backoff interval, use [WithRetryBackoff].

# Connection Management

When multiple addresses are passed via [WithURLs], the package will use them in
a round-robin fashion, and will keep track of live and dead nodes. The status
of dead nodes is checked periodically.

To customize the node selection behaviour, provide a [Selector] implementation
via [WithSelector]. To replace the connection pool entirely, provide a custom
[ConnectionPool] implementation via [WithConnectionPoolFunc]. Discovery prefers
in-place Update() when the pool implements [UpdatableConnectionPool]; pool
replacement via [WithConnectionPoolFunc] happens only when Update() is not
available. Custom pools are synchronized by default; implement
[ConcurrentSafeConnectionPool] to opt out when your custom pool is already safe
for concurrent use.

# Logging

The package defines the [Logger] interface for logging information about request
and response. It comes with several bundled loggers for logging in text and
JSON.

Use [WithDebugLogger] to enable the debugging logger for connection management.

# Metrics

Use [WithMetrics] to enable metric collection and export.
